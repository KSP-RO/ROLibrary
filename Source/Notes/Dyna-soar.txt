Fuselage / Wing
    "On the upper wing surface and upper fuselage, where temperatures were no higher than 2,000°F, the thermal-protection panels were also of Rene 41 rather than of a refractory"
    "For the wing undersurface, and for other areas that were hotter than 2,000ºF, designers specified an insulated structure"


    Insulation “pre-shrunk” Q-felt 
    "density no greater than 6.2 pounds per cubic foot, one-tenth that of water. In addition, it withstood temperatures as high as 3,000°F. (1922.039 K)"


Nose Vought variant
    Layer 1 & 2:
    "The final Vought design used a monolithic shell of siliconized graphite that was
    covered over its full surface by zirconia tiles held in place using thick zirconia pins."
    "siliconized carbon coated carbon graphite cap with an insulating layer of a temperature-resistant ceramic covering Zirconia"

    Layer 3:
    "A heat shield stood behind the graphite, fabricated as a thick disk-shaped
    container made of coated TZM sheet metal and filled with Q-felt"

    The nose cap attached to the vehicle with a forged ring and clamp that also were of coated TZM.

Nose Boeing
    Layer 1
    "The Boeing concept used a monolithic zirconia nose cap that was reinforced
    against cracking with two screens of platinum-rhodium wire."

    Layer 2
    "Like its counterpart from Vought, this design also installed a heat shield that 
    used Q-felt insulation installed a heat shield that used Q-felt insulation"

The internal structure of the X-20A was a truss structure of Rene 41 steel.
The upper wing, body, and inside fin surfaces were also of Rene 41
Coated molybdenum was used for the leading edge panels and the lower wing surface
The nose cap was of zirconium

René 41 was also used to create the outer shell of the Mercury space capsule
